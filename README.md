# 🔥 Introduction
Few-Shot Sequence Labeling (FSSL) is a canonical paradigm for the tagging models, e.g., named entity recognition and slot filling, to generalize on an emerging, resource-scarce domain. Recently, the metric-based meta-learning framework has been recognized as a promising approach for FSSL. However, most prior works assign a label to each token based on the **token-level** similarities, which ignores the integrality of named entities or slots. To this end, in this paper, we propose ESD, an Enhanced Span-based Decomposition method for FSSL. ESD formulates FSSL as a **span-level** matching problem between test query and supporting instances.Specifically, ESD decomposes the span matching problem into a series of span-level procedures, mainly including **enhanced span representation**, **class prototype aggregation** and **span conflicts resolution**. Extensive experiments show that ESD achieves the new state-of-the-art results on two popular FSSL benchmarks, FewNERD and SNIPS, and is proven to be more robust in the nested and noisy tagging scenarios.

# 🚀 How to use our code?
## 💾 Enviroment
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
We run our code on a single NVDIA A40 GPU, and we use `torch1.8.0+cu111`:
```
pip install torch==1.8.0+cu111 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html
```

## 📚 Dataset
```
mkdir data
cd data
```
### FewNERD
We use the latest sampled dataset from [FewNERD](https://cloud.tsinghua.edu.cn/f/0e38bd108d7b49808cc4/?dl=1), which corresponds to the results of [the 6-th version FewNERD paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.07464v6.pdf).
The new sampled data fixs the data sampling bug, see [issue](https://github.com/thunlp/Few-NERD/issues/15).

```
wget -O data.zip https://cloud.tsinghua.edu.cn/f/0e38bd108d7b49808cc4/?dl=1
unzip data.zip
mv episode-data/* ./
rm -rf episide-data
```

### SNIPS
We use the sampled data from [SNIPS-FewShot](https://atmahou.github.io/attachments/ACL2020data.zip).

```
wget https://atmahou.github.io/attachments/ACL2020data.zip
unzip ACL2020data.zip
mv ACL2020data/* ./
rm -rf ACL2020data
cd ..
```
